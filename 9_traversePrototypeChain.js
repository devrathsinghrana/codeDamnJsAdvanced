/*
Using 'delete' and 'hasOwnProperty'
In this lab, youâ€™ll be passed an object and a property to add/delete on that object. Make sure of the following things:

You have to delete the property if it exists
You have to add the property to the object if it doesnâ€™t exist and set it to objects are cool string value.
Make sure your property check uses hasOwnProperty as the tests below might evaluate with some properties on prototypal chain too.
Also make sure you return the final object from the function
Example 1

{
  prop1: 100,
  __proto__: {
    prop2: 200
  }
}
If the above object is passed with the property to check as prop2, your returned object should be:

{
  prop1: 100,
  prop2: "objects are cool"
  __proto__: {
    prop2: 200
  }
}
Example 2

{
  prop1: 100,
  prop2: 200
}
If the above object is passed with the property to check as prop2, your returned object should be:

{
  prop1: 100
}
